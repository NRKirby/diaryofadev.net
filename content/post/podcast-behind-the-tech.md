Behind The Tech is a podcast from Kevin Scott with a focus on people who make a difference to the world with technology. Kevin is currently CTO for Microsoft and was an early employee at Google.

The inaugural episode was with [Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg), famed with creating the C# and TypeScript programming languages. That is quite something to be famous for, with millions of developers depending on these languages every day. At time of writing there are also episodes with [Alice Steinglass](https://code.org/about/leadership/alice_steinglass), leader of [Code.org](https://code.org/) and [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng), an influential leader in AI who was the founder of the Google Brain project and also co-founder of Coursera.
